## Longest Path in a Tree (PT07Z)
##### [Problem link](www.spoj.com/problems/PT07Z/)
###### solution using BFS two times 
i have used bfs two times to solve this problem.
When we apply **bfs** for the first time from any node (in my case i used the node 1) it will give me a node farthest from node 1 that is by the end of one bfs i will get one corner of the tree.
the longest path of a tree is the distance between two farthest corner nodes, so now we will start the bfs from the one already found corner node and now the answer will be the longest path in the tree.


### The problem can also be solved by DP(Dynamic Programming) Approach.:flushed:
#### If someone can contribute the dp solution then he/she is most welcome. :hugs:
